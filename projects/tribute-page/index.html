                <p id="introduction">
                    Christopher, born Reprobus, was of Canaanite lineage. He was a giant of great stature and a feared face.

                <p id="great-prince">
                    While serving with the king of Canaan, he desired to serve the greatest king to obey and serve. He found a king who had the reputation of being the greatest of the world, and began serving him. While serving the greatest king, he found out (thru a song) that the king feared another, the devil. When Christopher learned about one greater than the king he was serving, he left the king and sought out the devil to serve him.

                    He began serving the devil after finding him in a great desert. As they wandered in the desert, they came upon a standing cross, which made the devil flee from the path they were on. Christopher tricked the devil into telling him why he was fleeing from a cross, upon which Christopher decided to go and serve this person, who was Christ.

                <p id="hermit">
                    Christopher found a hermit in a desert that introduced him to Christ and informed him in the faith. The hermit asked Christopher to do two things which Christopher said he couldn't: fast and pray. The third task that the hermit required of Christopher was one that suited him well: He was to stand at the edge of a tumoultuous river and help all who desired to pass the river by carriying them on his shoulders.

                <p id="christ-child">
                    After doing this service for many days, he twice had a vision of a child asking him to bear him so he may cross the river. After unsuccessfuly finding the child upon waking up from the dream twice, on the third time he found the child that called to him. Christopher took the child and bore him on his shoulders and started to cross the river with the child on him. As he was doing so, the waters rose and became more and more torrential and the child was increasing in weight, so much so that Christopher tought he had the weight of the world on him. Christopher became afraid and feared of drowning but he was able to cross the river. Christopher inquired the child about his weight and the child answered him that he should not marvel at his weight. The child told Chistopher that he had just bore not only the whole weight of the world but the one who had created the world as well. The child told him that he was Jesus Christ, the king that Christopher was serving, and that for Christopher to know it was true, he was to set his staff next to his house and in the morning he will see it bear flowers and fruit. As soon as the child finished saying these things, he vanished. When Christopher returned home, he did as the child told him. The next morning he found his staff like a palm tree, bearing flowers, leaves and dates.
